Ground-based {SAR} ({GBSAR}) systems cover a wide range of applications in remote sensing. In the past few years, {mmWave} {MIMO} radars have shown interesting potential in this field due to their low cost, compact size, and high phase sensitivity. {MIMO} capability enables the angular discrimination of multiple targets in the same range as the radar sensor. However, current {mmWave} {MIMO} radars do not provide a high angular resolution that suffices in earth observation applications. To this end, we demonstrate the feasibility of combining mechanical rail and {MIMO} radars to obtain better cross-range resolution. Our experiments show that the ground-based {MIMO} {SAR} can obtain about 20 times better cross-range resolution than {MIMO} radar while improving the image quality with more than 10 {dB} improvement in the peak sidelobe ratio ({PSLR}) and signal-to-clutter ratio ({SCR}). Moreover, we provide a deeper investigation and comparison between the {MIMO} {GBSAR} and conventional monostatic {GBSAR} images. According to the results, {MIMO} {GBSAR} provided a similar angular resolution and {PSLR} but with a lower {SCR} than the monostatic {GBSAR}. The effects of mechanical rail instability are also investigated. According to the obtained results, the rail’s instability causes around a 5 {dB} decrease in the obtained {SAR} image’s focusing capability.},

	abstract = {This study develops a ground-based synthetic aperture radar ({GBSAR}) imaging system and interferometric processing framework for structural health monitoring ({SHM}). Radar remote sensing for displacement monitoring plays a vital role in {SHM}. Radar sensors and, more specifically, {GBSAR} systems have gained more attention in recent studies due to their capability to overcome the limitations of other contact or non-contact {SHM} sensors. This paper proposes a three-dimensional {SAR} imaging system and advanced signal processing scheme to extract continuous (fast) displacement components, such as structural vibrations, and discontinuous (slow) displacements, such as subsidence or uplift, using {SAR} time-series datasets. Using controlled experiments, this study shows that the developed {GBSAR} can monitor sub-millimeter displacements with high spatial resolution and 0.02 mm precision in the {LOS} direction. Moreover, several simulations are carried out to evaluate the proposed displacement monitoring algorithms. Accordingly, the proposed continuous monitoring framework can measure fast {LOS} displacements with better than 0.03 mm precision by reducing the effects of radar movement, clutters, and disturbances. Also, evaluations on a simulated monitoring scene at 20 m from the {GBSAR}'s {LOS} show that the proposed discontinuous displacement monitoring algorithm can estimate 3D displacement vectors with sub-millimeter precision. The results show that the developed {GBSAR} can be used for repeat-pass {LOS} displacement monitoring and the proposed algorithms demonstrate high potential for measuring continuous sub-second {LOS} displacements and long-term 3D displacement vectors.},

	abstract = {While deep learning models have been extensively applied to land-use land-cover ({LULC}) problems, it is still a relatively new and emerging topic for separating and classifying wetland types. On the other hand, ensemble learning has demonstrated promising results in improving and boosting classification accuracy. Accordingly, this study aims to develop a classification system for mapping complex wetland areas by incorporating deep ensemble learning and satellite datasets. To this end, time series of Sentinel-1 dual-polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar ({SAR}) dataset, alongside Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery ({MSI}), are used as input data to the model. In order to increase the diversity of the extracted features, the proposed model, herein called {WetNet}, consists of three different submodels, comprising several recurrent and convolutional layers. Furthermore, multiple ensembling sections are added to different stages of the model to increase the transferability of the model (to other areas) and the reliability of the final results. {WetNet} is evaluated in a complex wetland area located in Newfoundland, Canada. Experimental results indicate that {WetNet} outperforms the state-of-the-art deep models (e.g., {InceptionResnetV}2, {InceptionV}3, and {DenseNet}121) in terms of both the classification accuracy and processing time. This makes {WetNet} an efficient model for large-scale wetland mapping application.

	abstract = {By increasing the applicability of ground-based {SAR} ({GBSAR}) systems in geoscience and remote sensing, the development and evaluation of new systems have gained attention. {GBSAR} systems can be utilized for monitoring areas that are hard to or cannot be seen by the airborne or spaceborne systems. Furthermore, they have better spatial and temporal resolutions and are cost-effective and easy to implement. This paper develops and evaluates a {GBSAR} system by combining a multiple-input multiple-output ({MIMO}) radar and mechanical linear rail as a synthetic aperture in azimuth direction ({MIMO} {GBSAR}) in a simulated environment. The considered radar sensor consists of two transmitters and four receiver antennas, operating at the W band frequency between 76-81 {GHz}. Azimuth compression consists of two main steps: {MIMO} beamforming and then compressing all gathered signals in the azimuth direction. According to the simulated results, the proposed {MIMO} {GBSAR} is able to improve the azimuth angular resolution to 4.9 mrad, compared to the 400 mrad angular resolution of the simple {MIMO} radar. A monostatic radar sensor requires 920 steps to complete a 0.9 m linear synthetic aperture, while the proposed {MIMO} {GBSAR} requires 115 steps, which implies a faster data acquisition rate. A simulated experiment was conducted in order to evaluate the interferometric capability of the considered sensor. The target’s displacement rate was considered 0.1 millimeters per epoch. According to the results, the errors’ amplitude was smaller than 1.5 micrometer, and the average displacement error was 0.32 micrometer.},

They are lightweight, cost-efficient, and resolve the main limitations of airborne and spaceborne {SAR} systems, such as low data collection rate, complicated implantation, and inefficient viewing angle to the imaging scene. This paper evaluates the signal processing results of the developed and implemented {GBSAR} system at the microwave remote sensing laboratory ({MRESL}) of the University of Tehran. The radar sensor consists of linear frequency modulated continuous wave ({LFMCW}) operating in S-band with 330 {MHz} of bandwidth that is mounted on a 1.4 m linear rail with a stepper motor. The radar sensor moves every 1 cm and records the backscattered echoes. After the dechirping process and digitizing, the recorded signal is stored in a two dimensional array, known as {SAR} 2D raw matrix. Experiments were conducted by illuminating the {SAR} sensor toward a scene containing corner reflectors. {SAR} raw data were processed by implementing the Backprojection algorithm, and results were evaluated and compared with numerical simulations. Furthermore, the Hann window was employed as a weighting function on the raw signal, and its effect was evaluated on the resulting {SAR} image. The obtained results are promising and show the effectiveness of the developed {GBSAR} in the discrimination of targets at two range and cross-range directions.},

	abstract = {The wellbeing of pipelines is influenced by a range of factors, such as internal and external pressures, as well as deterioration over time due to issues like erosion and corrosion. It is thus essential to establish a reliable monitoring system that can precisely examine pipeline behavior over time in order to prevent potential damages. To this end, pipelines are inspected based on internal and external approaches. Radar, as a non-contact sensing system, can be a suitable choice for external pipeline inspection. Radar is capable of the transmission and receiving of thousands of signals in a second, which reconstructs the displacement signal and is used for a vibration analysis. Synthetic aperture radar ({SAR}) imaging adds cross-range resolution to radar signals. However, a data acquisition rate of longer than several seconds makes it unsuitable for sub-second vibration monitoring. This study aims to address this limitation by presenting a method for high-resolution vibration monitoring using ground-based {SAR} ({GBSAR}) signals. To this end, a signal processing method by modifying the radar\&rsquo;s signal model is presented, which allows for estimating scattering targets\&rsquo; vibration parameters and angle of arrival with high resolution. The proposed method is validated with numerical simulation and a real case study comprising water pipelines. Moreover, various analyses are presented for the in-depth evaluation of the method\&rsquo;s performance in different situations. The results indicate that the proposed method can be effective in detecting pipeline vibration frequencies with micro-scale amplitudes while providing high spatial resolution for generating accurate vibration maps of pipelines. Also, the comparison with the radar observations shows a high degree of agreement between the frequency responses with the maximum error of 0.25 Hz in some rare instances.},

	abstract = {An increasing availability of remote sensing data in the era of geo big-data makes producing well-represented, reliable training data to be more challenging and requires an excessive amount of human labor. In addition, the rapid increase in graphics processing unit ({GPU}) processing power has enabled the development of advanced deep learning ({DL}) algorithms, which achieve impressive results in the field of satellite image processing. However, they require a huge and comprehensive training dataset to avoid overfitting problems and to represent a generalizable model. Thus, moving toward the development of non-supervised deep learning ({NSDL}) models in different remote sensing applications is an inevitable need. To provide an initial response to that need, this paper performs a comprehensive review and systematic meta-analysis of recently published research articles focusing on the applications of {NSDL} for remote sensing data processing. In order to identify future research directions and formulate recommendations, we extract trends and highlight interesting approaches from this large body of literature. Consequently, current challenges, prospects, and recommendations are also discussed to uncover the trend. According to the results, there is a sharp increasing trend in the applicability of {NSDL} methods during these few years particularly, with the advent of new deep architectures, such as adversarial, graph, and transformer models. As a result, this review paper discusses different remote sensing data processing applications and challenges that can be addressed using {NSDL} approaches.},
