I'm a Remote Sensing Engineer specializing in Radar and Microwave Remote Sensing, with a solid background in Geomatics. My research and projects revolve around the application of remote sensing in the fields of Earth observation and environmental monitoring. I have gained expertise in radar and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) processing and I have worked with diverse remote sensing data in both the optical and microwave domains. Additionally, I have explored and developed machine (deep) learning and computer vision algorithms for remote sensing data processing.

During my PhD, my main focus was on developing signal processing methods for high-resolution monitoring of structural displacements using ground-based SAR (GBSAR) sensors. I have also developed a range of geospatial and earth observation algorithms and frameworks using data-driven machine (deep) learning methods for tasks including land-use land-cover classification, building detection, change detection, object detection, and anomaly detection.
